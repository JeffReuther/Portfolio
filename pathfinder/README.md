This project was created for two reason:
1.  To make an app to help map out my local grocery store, or any location, so that I can most efficiently find products.
2.  To make a JavaScript pathfinding algorithm that uses basic, vanilla JavaScript.

I plan to implement it in such a way that items can be added, as with a todo list, and the app will enter/exit, navigate walls, and provide an estimated time for the trip.
