# Portfolio

This is a Portfolio project for my personal portfolio website, https://www.jeffreyreuther.com.

There is only one main project included in the portfolio at this moment: a grocery store pathfinder app.

The portfolio itself uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Testing for the calc app is done through the TinyTest library. Feel free to use code without permission.
