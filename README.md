# Portfolio

This is a Portfolio project for my personal portfolio website, https://www.jeffreyreuther.com.

There are three main projects included in the portfolio: a 'Conway's Game of Life' app, a calculator app, and a todo-list app.

The portfolio itself uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Testing for the calc app is done through the TinyTest library. Feel free to use code without permission.
