              I wrote this website in HTML and CSS, but my real love is learning. <br /> <br />
              I love the challenge of figuring out a codebase piece-by-piece. You can find me contributing to open source.

              I'm always learning more about JavaScript and C#, but I find CLIs like bash interesting and management tools like git indispensible. <br /> <br />
              I also test each project for possible vulnerabilities and edge cases that may arise.

              I wrote for my college newspaper and newsletters, and I enjoyed writing-technique books. I don't have much time for it now, but I hope to get back to it someday. <br />
